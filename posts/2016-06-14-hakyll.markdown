tags: Hakyll, GitHub

1. Create a [GitHub user page](https://pages.github.com/). Follow the
directions there to create a "Hello world" site. Don't proceed until
that works.
2. Register a domain.
3. [Point your domain at your GitHub user pages site](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-repository/).
It may take 3+ hours before your domain propagates. Don't continue until
this works.
4. Install [stack](http://www.haskellstack.org)
5. Install hakyll via [`stack install hakyll`](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials/01-installation.html)
6. Follow [this tutorial](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials/github-pages-tutorial.html).
_However!_ You already have a `master` branch. That's OK. But you do want to
have a `CNAME` file (see step 3 in this list) in your `develop` branch. Ensure your site looks good before proceeding.
7. You might want to look at some

8. If you want code syntax highlighting, you need some
<a href="https://www.jdreaver.com/posts/2014-06-22-math-programming-blog-hakyll.html">additional
CSS</a>. A list of supported languages can be found in the

source code.
