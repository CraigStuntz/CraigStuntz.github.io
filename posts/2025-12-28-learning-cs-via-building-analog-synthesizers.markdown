title: "Learning Computer Science Via Building Analog Synthesizers at CodeMash 2026"
tags: CodeMash, presentations, synthesis

Being as you are a devoted reader of my blog, I presume that you already know a
thing or two about computer science? But what if you didn't know anything about 
computer science? What if you decided to learn about it by 
[building analog synthesizers](2023-02-20-building-a-synthesizer-0.html)? 

That's the premise of [my upcoming talk at CodeMash](https://events.codemash.org/2026CodeMashConference#/agenda?day=3&lang=en&sessionId=76186000008389209&viewMode=2).

> This presentation is an alternate history of your own journey learning 
> computer science. If you started learning all over again, and instead of 
> reading books on C# development or watching videos about Vue.js, you decided 
> to become a developer by building hardware analog synthesizers instead, what 
> would the programming world look like to you? Imagine that the first computer 
> you used was analog instead of digital, that you learned about abstraction 
> from op amps instead of base classes, and you had to solve problems with an 
> oscilloscope instead of a debugger. You might be very good at understanding 
> computational abstractions! Building an analog synthesizer from electronic 
> components is a fun way to learn about electrical engineering, but it also 
> holds many lessons about computer science. In this delightfully strange talk, 
> we will build several computational models from the transistors up, learn how 
> to debug from first principles, understand dynamic typing in terms of modular 
> synthesis, and also have a bunch of beeps, blorps, and solder. 

My goal is to have the strangest presentation at CodeMash. We will see if I 
succeed. If I don't, I hope I'm in the audience for the even weirder one.
