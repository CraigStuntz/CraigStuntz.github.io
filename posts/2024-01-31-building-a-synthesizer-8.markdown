At this point, I've built an oscillator, which makes sound, but one issue it has 
is that it never _stops_ making sound. It just runs forever, making a constant,
unchanging drone, and that makes it difficult to play interesting music. Playing 
distinct notes is going to require two more 
modules: An [Envelope Generator](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-eg/) 
and a [Voltage Controlled Amplifier](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-vca/). 

It doesn't really matter what order you build these in, but I decided to build 
the EG next because there are two of them in the full kit, and I wanted to space 
them out as much as possible.

## What Even Is an Envelope Generator?

An envelope allows you to vary the behavior of a sound over time. They're
frequently used to vary the volume, pitch, and filter cutoff of a sound, but
really they can vary any parameter of a synth. As noted above, without an 
envelope your oscillator will just run forever, which most people don't find
musically pleasing!

Here's an envelope from the Logic Pro Retro Synth[^WhyRetroSynth] plugin, which is similar to 
the envelopes you'll find on many non-modular keyboard synthesizers:

<figure class="">

<img src="/images/synth/LogicProVintageSynthAmpEG.png" loading="lazy" width="400px" alt="The AMP ENV from Logic Pro. We can see an attack, decay, sustain, and release setting on a visual graph. There is a volume slider to the right.">
</a>
<figcaption>Retro Synth Amp Env</figcaption>
</figure>

"A, D, S, and R," in this picture, refer to "Attack, Decay, Sustain, and 
Release," the four parameters of the envelope generator. This is the most common
kind of envelope generator. If you're not familiar with these parameters then 
I'd recommend [reading this article](https://www.perfectcircuit.com/signal/learning-synthesis-envelopes-1)
before continuing.

This looks superficially similar to the envelope generator that we'll be 
building, but it differs in some important aspects:

* The Retro Synth "envelope" is really more equivalent to a modular EG, VCA, 
  and Mixer all wired together. There is some complexity hidden here. 
* The Retro Synth envelope shown here is for amplitude (note volume) control
  _only._ (Retro Synth has a separate envelope which is hard-wired to filter
  cutoff or VCO pitch.) If you wanted to use an EG to modulate some other 
  control, such as the effect mix, well, you can't do that in Retro Synth. The
  EG module, on the other hand, can be connected to any other module with a 
  CV input. (Some software synths are more flexible than Retro Synth in this 
  respect and allow you to use an envelope to modulate any synth parameter.)
* With the Retro Synth envelope it's possible to have a slow attack followed by 
  a slow decay. As we'll see, the mki x es.EDU module can't do this, because it 
  would have made the circuit more complex.
* The Retro Synth envelope's attack, decay, and release rate controls are 
  linear; the attack, for example, increases as a straight line. The 
  mki x es.EDU envelope generator, on the other hand, follows a curve, which 
  looks approximately logarithmic. Both sound fine, but you'll hear the 
  difference, especially with a slow setting.

One thing which is common to nearly every synth envelope but might not be 
obvious to people who have not used them is that the controls here are:

* Attack _time_
* Decay _time_
* Sustain **_level_**
* Release _time_

One of these things is not like the other! This will turn out to be surprisingly
important in the discussion below. 

When using an envelope to control the note volume, you can change the shape of 
a note to be like an organ, which goes to full volume when you press a key and
turns the note off when you release it:

<figure class="">
<a href="/images/synth/VintageSynthOrganEnv.png">
<img src="/images/synth/VintageSynthOrganEnv.png" loading="lazy" width="400px" alt="An organ has a very short attack, no decay, sustain at 100%, and a very short release.">
</a>
<figcaption>Retro Synth Organ Envelope</figcaption>
</figure>

...or a piano, where the note spikes briefly to full volume and then fades, 
eventually to nothing, as you hold the key. If you release the key during the 
decay the volume will immediately drop to nothing:

<figure class="">
<a href="/images/synth/VintageSynthPianoEnv.png">
<img src="/images/synth/VintageSynthPianoEnv.png" loading="lazy" width="400px" alt="A piano has a very short attack, a slow decay, sustain at 0%, and an instant release.">
</a>
<figcaption>Retro Synth Piano Envelope</figcaption>
</figure>

A real piano has a somewhat more complex decay, but the Retro Synth envelope
can only do a linear decay. Other synths can do an exponential or arbitrary 
decay shape which will more accurately model a piano. 

It's pretty common to have envelopes which aren't really modeled after acoustic
instruments, for example with a "pad" sound. This might have a slow attack, a 
slow decay, sustain at 75%, and a slow release:

<figure class="">
<a href="/images/synth/VintageSynthPadEnv.png">
<img src="/images/synth/VintageSynthPadEnv.png" loading="lazy" width="400px" alt="A pad envelope">
</a>
<figcaption>Retro Synth Pad Envelope</figcaption>
</figure>

As noted, this is one of two envelopes in the Retro Synth plugin, which is 
quite simple and lacks a modulation matrix. Other synth
plugins have additional envelopes which can be arbitrarily routed to modulate
any parameter on the synth via a [modulation matrix](https://support.apple.com/guide/logicpro/use-the-mod-matrix-lgsifc8644a6/mac). 

## Modular Envelope Generators

With an Envelope Generator _module,_ you can accomplish these uses by connecting 
them to other modules:

|   Envelope use                       |   Modular equivalent                         |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Change volume of note as it's held   | EG connected to Voltage Controlled Amplifier |
| Change filter cutoff as note is held | EG connected to Voltage Controlled Filter    |
| Change pitch of note as note is held | EG connected to VCO pitch CV input           |

On a standard synthesizer you might have a separate envelope for each of these,
a switch on the envelope, or a modulation matrix to choose between these 
functions. With a modular syntesizer, there is "just" an envelope generator, but
you need to connect it to some other module to get it to do anything useful.[^OtherEGs] 

A keyboard suitable for controlling a modular synth will have a "Gate" output 
which goes high when a key is pressed and low when the key is released. (Again,
you don't get chords, at least not without a surprisingly large amount of work.)
So if you press a key for half a second and then release the key for half a 
second and repeat that cycle forever, the Gate output will look like a square 
wave with the low voltage at 0V and the high voltage at... well, it depends on the keyboard.

### The Eurorack "Standard," Redux

Reviewing 
[some of the online comments](https://www.modwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=259994), 
it seems that a few people had trouble with this module. Based on some of
the comments there, it seems that once again people are getting bitten by the 
fact that the "Eurorack standard" is anything but! To be more precise, different
keyboards and sequencers put out differing voltages on their Gate/Trigger output.

To quote from the Doepfer [A-100 Technical Details](https://doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm) 
document:

> The gate level +5V shown in the picture is only an example. Within the A-100 
> usually any voltage beyond about +3V is treated as "high" (e.g. +5V, +8V, 
> +10V, +12V will work) and will trigger an ADSR or any other module with a Gate

> sequencer). Any voltage below 1V is treated as "low". If the specification of

The circuit in the mki x es.EDU Envelope Generator is designed to trigger at 
3.8V. Quoting from the manual:

> I’ve set up a voltage divider to get our reference voltage. A 100k/47k 
> combination gives us approximately 3.8 V to work with. So whenever our input 
> voltage is higher than that, the comparator’s output will jump to +12 V. And 
> if it’s lower, it drops down to –12 V. Why did I choose that exact threshold? 
> To be honest, mostly just because I had packs of 100k and 47k resistors lying 
> on my table when I was testing this. But I still feel that 3.8 V is a
> decent value here.

Given the fuzziness of the specification, "because I had these packs of 
resistors conveniently at hand" is as good of a reason as any, and meets the 
Doepfer requirements.

I measured the output of my Novation SL MkIII's Gate output, and it's 5 V. People
on [the previously referenced thread](https://www.modwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=259994) 
claim that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5RSIWbZ6Vc" 
title="B*hr*ng*r: The Edgelords Of Music Production">B\*hr\*ng\*r</a> Neutron is only 3.3 V. Which 
"kind of almost" conforms to the Doepfer text ("usually/about"!), but is 
apparently low enough to cause some heartache with this kit. 

The instructions for the kit say:

> To properly test this circuit, you’ll need a square wave LFO and a module 
> with a CV input like a VCF.

In light of the above, you would want to consider your inputs carefully! 
You could use the VCO module, but probably not for the output _and_ 
input of the EG. My pocket scope has a function generator built in, but it can
only output a maximum of 2.5v peak to peak. 

My recommendation is to measure the output of the actual device you'll be using 
to control the module when you're finished with it. I don't typically use my 
keyboard when building the modules, as it's big and I don't want to carry it 
around the house, but I did take care to note its output. You don't want to 
use one device when building a module and then be surprised by the power 
requirements of some other device when playing with the module.

Also, you might want to consider changing the resistor going into the comparitor
if you require supporting gear with a lower output. R9 in the schematic is a 
47k resistor. If you substitute a 33k restistor instead, then I calculate that
you'll change the trigger threshold to 3 V, which is maybe a better default?

### The mki x es.EDU Envelope Generator

Fundamentally, the way that the mki x es.EDU Envelope Generator module works is
that it applies a low-pass filter to its Gate input. A low-pass filter will tend to 
round off the corners of a sharp change in a signal. This turns what looks like a 
square wave (presuming that you're pressing and releasing a key at a constant
rate) into a smoother shape. 

In the first iteration which you build on the breadboard it applies only _one_ 
lowpass filter to the gate, giving you a more rounded shape. Then, by using a 
pair of diodes, two separate lowpass filters are used in the circuit, one for 
the rise, and a separate filter for the fall (see example on the right).

That's simple enough, but it's a little _too_ simple, even for these circuits, 
as just a couple of filters would allow you to control the attack and the release
but not have a sustain. So, as you'll see, things become a bit more compliacted.

## Breadboarding the Envelope Generator

### Passive vs. Active Circuits

<figure class="inlineRight">
<a href="/images/synth/EGPassive.png">
<img src="/images/synth/EGPassive.png" loading="lazy" width="400px" alt="There is a yellow square wave representing the Gate signal overlaid with a purple trace representing the envelope output. This purple trace raises slowly and asymptotically to the top of the yellow trace, and then when the yellow trace goes back to zero it slowly goes down, again following a roughly exponential curve.">
</a>
<figcaption>Passive trace</figcaption>
</figure>

We start by building a passive EG, but as you can't hook it up to anything which
draws more current than an oscilloscope without changing the envelope, that's 
really only good for demonstrating the principle of operation of the EG. 
Building a "useful" EG will require some op amps. 

If you look at the "Passive trace" figure on the right, the yellow trace is the square wave I
am using as the input to the EG, and the purple trace is the output of the EG.
As you can see, the output of the passive circuit is limited to the voltage of
the input to the EG (which, as previously noted, is not consistent 
between different keyboards you might use to produce that input). Also, the 
output impedance would not be handled well; the 
shape of the waveform would change depending upon what you connected to the EG's
output.

<figure class="inlineRight">
<a href="/images/synth/EGActive.png">
<img src="/images/synth/EGActive.png" loading="lazy" width="400px" alt="Active trace">
</a>
<figcaption>Active trace</figcaption>
</figure>

With the active EG the output voltage (see the "Active trace" figure) is now independent of
the input voltage, and the impedance would be better handled, due to the use
of a buffer op amp. Here's what that looks like on the breadboard:

<figure>

</a>
<figcaption>Two pots and counting..."</figcaption>
</figure>

(If you look _really closely_ at this photo you'll notice an extra resistor I've
added to bring the voltage threshold down to about 2 V to start the EG. As noted
above, my function generator has a limited voltage range.)

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

### Attack, Decay/Release, Sustain Controls

<figure class="inlineRight">
<a href="/images/synth/EGADSRPulse.png">
<img src="/images/synth/EGADSRPulse.png" loading="lazy" width="400px" alt="ADSR trace with pulse">
</a>
<figcaption>ADSR trace</figcaption>
</figure>

I'm going to explain how the attack and decay are implemented in the circuit. 
This is, ironically considering it was done to keep the circuit itself simple, 
somewhat complicated to understand, so feel free to skip ahead to the next 
section if you're so inclined. 

In the images in this section, the Gate input is the yellow trace, the EG output
is the purple trace, and the internal signal which the EG mixes into its input
before shaping it with the filters
is the cyan trace. The envelope _starts_ at the center of the screen, not the 
left side. 

The way a "real" envelope generator works on a commercial
synth works is first the attack happens, taking the envelope to its maximum 
level. Then the decay, as it goes to the sustain level, and finally, when the 
key is released, the release happens. 

With the mki x es.EDU kit, on the other hand, the decay only has a chance to 
happen when the attack is quite short. If you look at the "ADSR trace" on the right 
you can see that with a short attack, the decay can happen, followed by the 
sustain and release. This is the "best case scenario" for this circuit. With
roughly this shape, you can adjust the attack (a little!), the decay/release
times as a single value, and set a sustain level. 

<figure class="inlineRight">
<a href="/images/synth/EGSlowAttack.png">
<img src="/images/synth/EGSlowAttack.png" loading="lazy" width="400px" alt="ADSR trace with slow attack">
</a>
<figcaption>ADSR trace with slow attack</figcaption>
</figure>

When I dial in a longer attack, there is no decay; in this case the attack 
takes its time to even arrive at the sustain level, wherever that happens to 
be set. Importantly, the attack in this case only goes to the sustain level; it
does not go to 100% as a standard synthesizer attack would do (even with this
long attack).

Note how the attack level is much higher in the "ADSR trace" example, and how
the attack only goes to the "sustain" level in the 
"ADSR trace with slow attack" example.

This is because of how the EG works. If you look at the figure 
called "ADSR trace with slow attack," you can see a third, cyan trace. The cyan
trace has a pulse which is fired when the input goes high. As you can see, the 
pulse is pretty short. One way to think about the duration of the pulse is that
it's the maximum length of time your attack can be for there to still have a
separate decay. You can have a longer attack, yes, but if you do then:

1. You won't get any decay, and
2. Your attack will only go to the sustain level, not to 100%.

One way to think about the mki x es.EDU EG is that it's _two low-pass filters_ on
the sum of the gate signal and the internal control signal (one filter controls 
the speed of the attack; the second controls the speed of the decay _and_ 
release). The lower we set the
low-pass filters, the more we round the corners of the square gate signal into 
smooth curves. 

The envelope needs a sustain, and that can't be accomplished with just filters. 
So instead of filtering the Gate signal directly, instead it 
first produces an internal control signal, represented by the cyan trace in the 
images just above. 
The EG generates a pulse at the start of the Gate 
similar to the "Trigger" output that some keyboards have, and separately reduces 
the gate down to a sustain level which you can adjust 
with a potentiometer. These two signals are mixed together, forming a shape like 
the cyan trace below. Just like before, you can vary the attack speed with 
one pot and the descending phases (decay and release) with another pot. 

<figure class="horizontalTiles">
<a href="/images/synth/EGPulse.png">
<img src="/images/synth/EGPulse.png" loading="lazy" width="400px" alt="This shows the signal which will be used to generate the envelope. It has a thin bar going up to 100% on the left followed by a sustain level at about 50% for the rest of the pulse. Also shown is the square wave which is the input to the E.">
</a>
<figcaption>Pulse (tiny dot at the top)</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="horizontalTiles">
<a href="/images/synth/EGPulseMeasure.png">
<img src="/images/synth/EGPulseMeasure.png" loading="lazy" width="400px" alt="The same image as before, only it's overlaid with measurement cursors showing that the width of the attack pulse is 16 ms">
</a>
<figcaption>...with measurement</figcaption>
</figure>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

In this example the input the the EG is shown in yellow and the wave which the
EG will round off using filters to become its output is shown in cyan. The
high pulse on the left always goes to 100%, and the sustain for the rest of the
cycle is settable by the user. Here I've adjusted it to around 50%. The width
of the pulse on the left is not assignable by the user; it's always small; here
I have measured it at a about 16 ms.

So, if you use anything besides a very short attack then it will take 
longer than the pulse at the beginning of the envelope and will go to the 
sustain level instead of all the way to 100%.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

### LED

I added an LED, and a transistor to drive it.

### Inversion

<img src="/images/synth/EGInverted.png" loading="lazy" width="400px" alt="Inverted trace">
</a>
<figcaption>Inverted trace</figcaption>
</figure>

This time the blue trace on the right is showing the inverted output. No surprise
there; it uses 
[an op amp in an inverting configuration](/posts/2023-04-03-building-a-synthesizer-4.html#inverter) 
to produce this output.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

### Looping the Envelope

I found this section somewhat hard to understand, not least because the 
directions lead off with a confusing bit of language:

<figure>
<a href="/images/synth/EGManualConfusion.png">
<img src="/images/synth/EGManualConfusion.png" loading="lazy" width="800px" alt="Screenshot of the Looping the Envelope section of the manual, with a looping circuit diagram and the text &quot;You just patch it in between output (on the right) and input (on the left) &quot;">
</a>
<figcaption>It's your other left...</figcaption>
</figure>

I had thought this was a mistake; the input is on the right and the output
is on the left. 
[Looking at the circuit simulator seemed to confirm this](https://tinyurl.com/y7wh2o6u).
It was only when I watched 
[Moritz's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9vTz0vm6pc) that I 
realized he was talking about the _envelope generator_ inputs and outputs, not
the I/O for the Schmitt trigger circuit pictured above. The _output_ of
the Schmitt trigger goes to the _input_ of the envelope generator, and vice/versa!


In the end the way that this produces a loop is pretty simple, and here's how
I would explain it:

First, this circuit produces a _specific type of loop._ Namely, it loops 
whenever the envelope output goes to zero. This is quite reasonable, but it 
confused me as it's not the sort of loop which 
you would get if you connected an LFO to the gate input of the EG, which would 
always happen on a certain timeframe regardless of where the envelope
is in its cycle. The EG's loop circuit always happens after the release.  
Given that requirement, then we just
need a circuit which will make the input go high whenever the output goes low.
That sounds like a Schmitt trigger inverter, something which you'll be familiar 
with if you've previously built the mki x es.EDU VCO, and the circuit shown is 
just building a Schmitt trigger inverter using an op amp and a few passive
components. 

However, my confusion only got worse as I looked deeper into this step. I had
found the breadboard diagrams increasingly difficult to line up with the schematics as
the breadboard got more densely packed, and I ended up annotating the diagram
in this step. It differs from the schematic in the step in a couple of important
ways, and all of the jumpers and the unlabeled pots, op amps, and jacks had 
finally pushed past the point where I could keep track of this in my head.

<figure>
<a href="/images/synth/EGHuh.png">
<img src="/images/synth/EGHuh.png" loading="lazy" width="800px" alt="A schematic diagram of the full EG circuit with a breadboard diagram of the mostly-equivalent circuit below it, with a few differences circled and some annotations added to identify specific parts.">
</a>
<figcaption>Schematic and Breadboard</figcaption>
</figure>

These are _mostly_ the same as the diagrams from the manual, only I have added
all of the colored annotations. Note, especially, the red circles. The 
breadboard version of the circuit does not include the switch (the components 
for the Gate input section are on the board, but they're "permanently switched 
off" in this version), and in the breadboard version the resistor goes to the 
negative rail instead of ground. That last bit just seems like an error to me
&ndash; the full schematic and the PC board layout later in the directions match
the schematic here. So I ended up not doing this part. 

### The Mistake I Made

Another problem I had during the breadboarding of this circuit was at one point
I mistakenly connected my oscilloscope's ground clip to the -12V rail instead
of ground. This made the output very distorted and caused the power supply to 
the synthesizer to start getting hot. It took me a while to find the issue because
the way you route power to breadboards with two power rails when you need three
is a little consuing. The video about why this is a bad idea is literally called 
[How NOT To Blow Up Your Oscilloscope!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaELqAo4kkQ)

## Modifications: Can We Fix the Limitation on the Attack?

The limitation to very short attack times is somewhat less than ideal, so could
we fix it? The "pulse" used to generate the attack is set to a pretty short 
duration, and it's not adjustable. What if it were adjustable? That's not so
hard. We could replace the attack potentiometer with a stereo potentiometer 
(which is really just two separate potentiometers with a single shaft to adjust
them). Then we could use one of these for the attack time, as before, and the 
second for adjusting the width of the pulse. 

So [I tried this out in the circuit simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html?ctz=CQAgjCAMB0l3BWcAmALNZA2VAOMmB2SBVATlIQJAMxCVQGY6BTAWjDACgAlEd5HHVSo+YAXTFQpqSCimyYCTgHMpJEbISYFUTgCc+2ISP6D1UsPDj7DI85uHSi1gO62QjZO-ucAhu9R8EAYvQNpSOX5wKzhg6BwGQgZUTFIGHAICBAQwKhh8UkwBRgJSUuQKiMsrG0KPILrsHWr4TgATYNCG2jCQLzAAOUDcTgB5EEIvdJEiEWn5GwRSKZwRSeDVi1b-Mlp5pZWRQUkolvgoDFQBLKv8MBzEC7RrghwESES0-EJomrdd4KYQQAkIKTj-OqgujLTpgtwHWHQw66NxgGEyWQVEQYlHgGEMRJ40KxSDgkCQwloqaE0luSGbCm0Un+Oo4qkeWLHLynGKyVgweA4DJFd4lbDCSBUfmwOBCmgE5ZwMC4V5MM6k3isZCQMyOLUELz2PoePrQJDIM3yM1krEczFoQGCWl9B0422eXQdW2JQQCQQ+42DYY4dp9IUeEIu7GR-pDZUh3IiP2OjZzIFbGIXR4AQQAKrnswBhADSnETYeBkYDwidvysWeIIAAIgBRQvZgCaAHpuC2ADIt7MAZRbZIJewQ1L22tx48R8yhzoXM4X6aXhJrwQ3ODhW56O9THgPS82uFk8w9J7TwKCAavEa6PUjzt6HtfJLJvWrQRxL5-sRSbEPwAYw8IwcUAo8dAFKwIBgZ4Mled5PgYb48hlLhVEgs8wOxOowQAD2CDgOT2TAIBkCIjhAAA1ABJbMAB0AGchzo1sACFs24TgiNQuYymCBBgQAkBBGzJsACkAFUh1zFjZN44IIiwWQZCYLAmCTQQAAUR2kptRlYCSh24FiWwGGj+1GHTRwhHoAPAj83FYJy+Q4YkwVUdhJEgnzQmPXF2EcHF2G0O1PVEcK-PwNTYljYMVCitSjDCtTAtJUC0oirUdQihQZXgODoAKIpVgYUpykqBsuBc7VdRMer8rJVy1gNPgmvWUkOkjTAtAmNZ+oS+M-HcPrpwmfquVEfpeTiBIkhSNJEOyXIM1aFyjHMVqBt3XKGo6vKurLAg1kG2gPMmpk6xJaAz21XkYioIdZILOiBiS5VzvARwgVrZ0xEEcafu+0kiJoCZXhQCAgQosSQAkmS5JYgBZUdwaYIEqDETHSDU+H6KY1j2JbLieIAIz4OcmtKCBTqZE6TEuzd-PqC6boK8h3ke2CEYAFz53xgIAaxAZiAAcAEtheYFrmaCVnfzl3zcFEXyjGdYKgPc8QlZcwGcuZ5yZpEnXKy8UkAHtwHNfq4vIPoCqsMpxuQJBMRt4JOGt307fqSAvBnfJwHATggA), 
and it seems to work, for the 
most part. (Except that the falstad.com simulator has no stereo potentiometers; 
I had to use two mono pots with separate adjustments.) But I can certainly make
the attack longer by increasing the resistance of what used to be a single 10k
resistor and is now a potentiometer. Overall it feels like an improvement.

Actually including it in the final project would require changes in packaging
since the stereo pot is larger than a mono pot, and changes to the circuit.
More importantly, I would need to tweak the resistor/capacitor values in the 
lowpass filter at the input so that the range of the pot was correct for both 
the pulse length and the attack curve across the full range of the stereo pot.

## Building the PC Board

This all went very smoothly except at one point I mixed up a 100 k and a 100 
ohm resistor. These two are very different! I fixed this before powering the 
circuit.

[^WhyRetroSynth]: I chose this comparison because Retro Synth is a very simple plugin. Other 
plugins such as Alchemy allow you to add an arbitrary number of envelopes routed
to any parameter on the synth, having very complex shapes. That would be a huge
digression here.

[^OtherEGs]: In this sense the EG module is more like the envelopes in Alchemy, which can be 
used to modulate literally any knob on the soft synth, than the envelopes in 
Retro Synth, which are "hard-wired" to just three parameters. Logic Pro also has 
a "Modulator" Midi Effects plugin, which is a bit more like
the envelope generator we'll be building here in that it can be connected to 
nearly any plugin parameter, and functions both as an envelope generator and an
LFO.
