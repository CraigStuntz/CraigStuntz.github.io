I'll present "[Secure Applications, by Design](https://stirtrek.com/sessions/session/87)" 
on Friday 4 May at [Stir Trek](https://stirtrek.com/), 
and "Shifting Application Security Left on Monday 14 May at the 
[2018 Central Ohio Infosec Summit](https://www.infosecsummit.com/ehome/2018cbusinfosec/agenda/).

Both of these talks are about bridging the gap between development and 
security teams. In fact, they're almost the same presentation, except that 
"Secure Applications, by Design" is aimed at developers, and "Shifting 
Application Security Left" is written for infosec professionals. But the
outline of each talk is very similar. The biggest difference between the two 
is what I _don't_ say. There are a lot of "security basics" in the former
which I skip in the latter.

If you're interested in the overall idea of how developers and security
professionals can work together to create better applications, but haven't 
seen that work well in real world projects, I'd be very pleased if you'd 
attend one of these and share your feedback with me.
