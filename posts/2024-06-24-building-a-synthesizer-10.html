<h2 id="what-even-is-a-vca">What Even Is a VCA?</h2>
<p>If you have used keyboard/desktop style synthesizers but not modular synths,
you may have seen a “VCA” section of your synth before, or, depending on the
synth in question, you may have just seen a dial somewhere with a different
label.</p>
<p>A VCA allows you to use one control voltage to adjust the level of another
signal. The most common use is to use the output of an envelope generator to
adjust the level of the VCO’s output (turning an unchanging drone into a note
with an attack, decay, etc.). But there are many other uses for
a VCA!</p>
<p>Still, because the two uses above are so common, in many synthesizers the “VCA”
is represented as a “Volume” knob somewhere, or as a slider by an envelope
generator.</p>
<p>For example, here are two synthesizers with two different labels for the same
feature:</p>
<figure class="horizontalTiles">
<a href="../images/synth/VCAJupiter8.png">
<img src="../images/synth/VCAJupiter8.png" loading="lazy" height="300px" alt="The VCA section of the Roland Jupiter 8 synthesizer. It has a continuous slider marked Level and a four position switch marked LFO Mod">

</a>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<div style="clear:both  ;">

</div>
<p>On the left is the “VCA” section of the Roland Jupiter-8. You get two controls:
A simple level slider, and a four position switch which controls how much one of
the synth’s LFOs affects the output. On the right is the Retro Synth plugin from
Logic Pro; here the “VCA” feature is just sort of implied by the envelope and
a slider labeled “Vel” (for Velocity) to the right of
the two envelope generators. Neither of these have a “control (voltage) input,”
because they are hard-wired to the envelope and the LFO, in the case of the
Jupiter-8, and to the envelopes, in the case of Retro Synth.</p>
<p>In the modular world it’s pretty common for a VCA to be a separate module, but
you may end up using them in exactly the same way: You want to turn the endless
drone of a VCO into distinct notes, so you connect an Envelope Generator to your
keyboard’s Gate output and you connect the output of the EG into the control
voltage input of a VCA. You then connect the VCO’s output into the audio signal
input of the VCA, and the output of the VCA now has distinct notes when you
press a key. Success!</p>
<p>However, a VCA can be used for other applications; I’d recommend watching
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxr5fT-E7m0">this video</a> (particularly the
last two thirds) if you’d like to see examples.</p>
<h2 id="how-a-vca-works">How a VCA Works</h2>
<p>A VCA is simply a volume knob which can be controlled using a control voltage.
The control voltage is “…typically from -2.5 V to +2.5 V (5 Vpp) for LFOs, and
from 0 V to +8 V for ADSRs,” to quote the <a href="https://doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm">Eurorack (non-)specification</a>.
There’s usually two “volume knobs,” in series: A <em>real</em> volume knob you can set
with your fingers and an electronically controllable volume setting you set with
a control voltage.</p>
<p>We know how potentiometers work, and the “real” volume knob is just one of
those, with an op amp for isolation and gain. But how does a control voltage
controlled volume knob work? If we ccould find such a thing as a “voltage controlled
resistor,” that would do the trick. It sounds like something which could be done
with an op amp, but it would require a somewhat less common circuit, called an
operational transconductance amplifier (or OTA) instead. These tend to have an
amplifier bias or <span class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em><em>C</em></sub></span> input which will control the gain of the amplifier
based on the current going into that input. But other designs are possible, and
as we will see the MKI x ES.EDU VCA is based on individual transistors instead
of an integrated circuit like an OTA.</p>
<h2 id="breadboarding-the-vca">Breadboarding the VCA</h2>
<p>Before I start breadboarding I ususally separate out the various resistor
values, set them in order, and tape them to a piece of paper with their values
in Ohms written alongside them.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Before you start breadboarding, carefully look at the 10k, 20k, and
100k resistors. There are two different kinds! See the section
<a href="#resistance-is-futile">“Resistance is Futile,”</a> below, for details. The manual
does not include this distinction in the Bill of
Materials nor mention it at all unitl much later. You will want to keep these
two types of resitors separate, as it will make your life easier later on.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="breadboarding-the-volume-potentiometer">Breadboarding the Volume Potentiometer</h3>
<p>The first thing we are asked to build is a volume control using just a
potentiometer. Not exciting, but the idea is that a VCA will essentially be
just controlling volume using a control voltage instead of a knob. Of course the
truth is somewhat more complex, given the need to isolate modules from each
other in terms of impedance, but we’ll get there. Anyway, having built that
we can verify that we can indeed vary the volume of a signal passing through
our not-quite-yet-voltage-controlled-amplifier by twisting the potentiometer
knob. Moving right along…</p>
<h3 id="how-a-bipolar-junction-transistor-works">How a Bipolar Junction Transistor Works</h3>
<p>If you look up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor">Bipolar Junction Transistor on Wikipedia</a>
or in many electronics books, the description will start with a discussion of
“P-type” and “N-type” semiconductors, and at the end you still won’t have a
good idea of what they do. Instead, I’m going to go with what Professor Aaron
Lanterman calls the “magic elves theory,” and describe what they do without
explaining the physical implementation, instead saying, “they do it that way
because the magic elves inside make it happen.” This is actually similar to
<a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2015/06/17/the-original-full-size-negative-of-transistor-man-that-was-used-in-the-first-edition-of-art-of-electronics-photos-electronicsbook/">the “transistor man” presentation in Horowitz and Hill’s <em>The Art of Electronics</em></a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of these kits is perhaps more
about teaching you how electronics work than it is about building
the greatest synthesizer in the world. We’ve used a couple of transistors in
the past, but we haven’t gone very deep into how the work. So, no time like the
present! <a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/media/VCA_MANUAL_FINAL.pdf">The instructions</a>
now take a (pages-long) digression into how transistors, and
bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) in particular, work. I won’t repeat that
here, but there is a points that I found confusing which I would like to try and
clarify.</p>
<p>In the VCO kit we used a transistor as a kind of variable resistor controlled by
the base input. The VCA instructions spend a good bit of time explaining why a
transistor is not, in fact, a resistor. A transistor provides resistance,
clearly: A fairly high resistance value when no voltage is connected to the base!
You can control the amount of current passing through the device using the
voltage you connect to the base.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>But resist<em>ance</em> is not the same as being a good resist<em>or</em>. A
transistor is designed to allow current to (easily) flow in only one
direction, unlike a resistor, and, also unlike a resistor, a transistor will
pass a fairly steady current regardless of voltage applied to the collector.
So the transistor is not a drop-in replacement for a resit<em>or</em>, even if it was
useful to us in supplying a
voltage-controlled <em>resistance</em> when building the VCO. It’s also noteworthy that
the VCO required a resistance which varied exponentially with the input control
voltage, and thus it’s super convenient to use a transistor, which more or less
does just this. With the VCA, however, we want the volume to change linearly
with the control voltage, so we will need to be careful about how we use the
transistors.</p>
<h4 id="the-problem-with-bjts">The Problem with BJTs</h4>
<p>One problem that BJTs have is that they are not very consistent devices. Even
BJTs from the same manufacturer with the same part number will vary in how much
current they pass and the precise base thresholds that control the transistor.
They will also vary considerably with the outside temperature.</p>
<p>So, we would like to compensate for these variations. How do we do that?</p>
<h4 id="negative-feedback">Negative Feedback</h4>
<figure class="inlineRight">
<a href="../images/synth/VCAManualNegativeFeedback.png">
<img src="../images/synth/VCAManualNegativeFeedback.png" loading="lazy" width="300px" alt="A transistor with the base connected to the input signal, the collector connected to the 12V rail through a 20k resistor, and the emitter connected to ground through a 10k resistor">
</a>
<figcaption>
From the mki x es.edu VCA Manual
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We start with a circuit much like the one on the right but without the 10k
resistor at the bottom. Then we get to the point that I found confusing!
Moritz talks about “introducing negative feedback” by connecting a resistor
between the transistor’s emitter and ground. That’s the 10k resistor at
the bottom of the circuit at right. What I didn’t understand was: A resistor is
a passive component; how could introducing just one resistor provide <em>any</em> kind of
feedback?</p>
<p>The answer is that although the resistor is passive, the transistor is very much
not passive, and putting a resistor between the emitter and ground makes a world
of difference because it changes the behavior of the transistor. How? When the
transistor’s emitter is connected directly to ground then <em>the emitter voltage will always be at
ground,</em> no matter what the base of the transistor is set to. But when there is
a resistor between the emitter and ground, things get more complicated.</p>
<p>A transistor is “active” when the voltage between the base and the emitter is
over a certain threshold, around 0.6V. When the transistor is active, current
will pass between both the base and the emitter and the collector and the emitter
(for an NPN transistor). This current flowing out of the emitter has to flow
across the 10k resostor. When a current flows across a resistor you get a
voltage. Therefore the voltage at the transistor’s emitter is no longer being
held at ground. Instead it varies depending upon the amount of current passing
through the resistor. And this change from “voltage is fixed at ground” to
“voltage varies with the amount of current being passed out of the emitter and
across the resistor” is the key to understanding how adding just that one
resistor can be called “negative feedback.” The more current that passes through
the resistor, the higher the voltage difference across its two ends will be,
right? However, this means that the end of the resistor connected to the emitter
will be at a higher voltage, and therefore the higher the current, the lower
the difference in voltage between the transistor’s base and emitter will be…
which reduces the current! This is the negative feedback.</p>
<p>Therefore, if something changes the gain of the transistor, such as its
temperature, this circuit will have the opposite effect: More amplification
means a higher voltage at the emitter which means a lower voltage from base to
emitter which means a lower gain!</p>
<h4 id="another-way-to-look-at-negative-feedback">Another Way to Look At “Negative Feedback”</h4>
<p>One of the things that confused me about the directions use of the phrase
“negative feedback” is that I hadn’t seen this phrase in other tutorials about
transistor amplification. But once I
understood what he meant by negative feedback I could line up what he was
saying with other explanations. So now I
will explain this in a different way, but I will be describing the same
“negative feedback” mentioned above. It helps me to have multiple ways to
consider the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>In this section I’m summmarizing the explanation from
<a href="https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/practical-electronics-inventors-fourth-edition-scherz-monk/9781259587542.html"><em>Practical Electronics for Inventors, Fourth Edition,</em></a>
by Scherz and Monk.</p>
<p>The gain of a transistor, by definition, is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$ \begin{align} Gain = \cfrac {V_{out}} {V_{in}} = \cfrac {\Delta V_{C}} {\Delta V_{E}} \approx \cfrac {R_{C}} {R_{E}} \end{align} $$</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline"><em>V</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> is equal to the voltage at the collector, <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> is equal to the
resistance at the collector, and similarly for the emitter. However, that’s not
quite the full story, because a transistor has a small internal
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transresistance">transresistance</a>
in its emitter region, and one way you can think about thermal instability in a
transistor is that the transreistance changes with temperature. So a somewhat
more accurate model is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$ \begin{align} Gain \approx \cfrac {R_{C}} {R_{E} + r_{tr}} \end{align} $$</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sub><em>t</em><em>r</em></sub></span> is the transresistance value, which, again, is not constant. This
is not 100% accurate as there is some small current flowing from the base to the
emitter. But this does tell us that we can minimize the effect of <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sub><em>t</em><em>r</em></sub></span> by
making <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span> comparatively large relative to it.</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$ \begin{align} r_{tr} \approx \cfrac {0.026 V} {I_E} \end{align} $$</span></p>
<p>How much is that? Well, we have <span class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span> <em>apporximately</em> 600 μA, which works out to
arount 46Ω. So a 10KΩ resistor should make its effects very small indeed. Scherz
and Monk say, “In practice, <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span> should be chosen to place <span class="math inline"><em>V</em><sub><em>E</em></sub></span> around 1 V
(for temperature stability and maximum swing in the output). Here we’re around
6V, but note that in the very next step we will be reducing the voltage at the
emitter!</p>
<h3 id="breadboarding-a-one-transistor-vca">Breadboarding a One Transistor VCA</h3>
<p>So now let’s build a VCA (with actual voltage control, not just a
potentiometer). It looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<a href="../images/synth/VCAOneTransistor.jpg">
<img src="../images/synth/VCAOneTransistor.jpg" loading="lazy" width="600px" alt="A breadboard showing a simple, one-transistor VCA circuit. We can see a BJT, a DIP op amp package, a potentiometer, and a 1/8 inch jack.">
</a>

<p>When we look at the output on a scope, though, the results are not so great:</p>
<figure>

<img src="../images/synth/VCAOneTransistorScope.png" loading="lazy" width="600px" alt="An oscilloscope screen capture showing a yellow trace with a square wave, a magenta trace with the same square wave although much fuzzier and lower in amplitude, and a cyan trace which is the magenta trace inverted">
</a>
<figcaption>

</figure>
<p>The yellow trace here is the output of a function generator I’m using as my
“signal.” This is like the audio signal I would be running through the VCA in
the real world. The magenta trace is the input into the base, and the cyan trace
is the VCA’s output at the jack. These last two look “blurry,” but note that the
vertical scale on the oscilloscope is much smaller for them. (20mV/div vs. 1V/div.)</p>
<h3 id="breadboarding-a-differential-amplifier">Breadboarding a Differential Amplifier</h3>
<p>There are a few problems with the circuit we have built so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor amplification (low gain)</li>
<li>It’s noisy</li>
<li>The output is inverted</li>
<li>It’s still sensitive to temperature variation in the resistors, even though
we have improved things by adding the resistor at the emitter</li>
<li>When we change the CV signal, the DC offset of the audio output changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Moritz proposes to fix all of this by using a
<a href="https://electrosome.com/differential-amplifier-transistors/">differential pair</a>
of transistors. So first we add a second transistor and arrange both in a
differential pair.</p>

<p>Now we get two outputs, which are in opposite phase:</p>

</a>
<figcaption>
Two Transistor VCA Output
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Adding a couple more transistors and the second op amp (in the same IC package
as the first one), we can combine the two signals, subtracting them to produce
the difference between them (hence, differential pair). This is an op amp
configuration which I didn’t show in
<a href="2023-04-03-building-a-synthesizer-4.html">my op amp tutorial</a>, so here it is:</p>
<figure>
<a href="../images/synth/VCAOpAmpSubtractor.png">

</a>
<figcaption>
Subtractor
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you’ve read that tutorial, you’ll understand how this works. It’s exactly the
same as an inverter configuration, except instead of having the non-inverting
(‘+’) input tied to ground, instead the non-inverting input of the op amp is
connected to another signal input, via a voltage divider. Without going into
too much detail in this post, it hopefully makes sense if you think that when
the non-inverting input is at ground this is exactly an inverter, because
0/ground minus the inverting input is the opposite of the inverting input.</p>
<p>Anyway, with the op amp outputting the difference of the two transistor signals,
our trace now looks like:</p>
<figure>
<a href="../images/synth/VCASubtractedTrace.png">

</a>
<figcaption>
Completed VCA
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The next step is to add a trimpot which allows adjustment to compensate for
small manufacturing differences between the two transistors. Even when both
transistors are at precisely the same temperature, two different transistors
of the same lot from the same manufacturer may vary in their gain. One way
around this is to buy a matched set of transistors in an IC package. Another way
around this is to add a trimpot:</p>
<figure>
<a href="../images/synth/VCAWithTrimpotTrace.png">

</a>
<figcaption>
Subtractor with Trimpot
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally we change some resistor values to make the last op amp in the signal
chain boost the amplified signal up to a 10V peak to peak output.</p>
<p>I realize the signal looks quite noisy. Some of that is real, because
breadboards tend to be pretty noisy. Some of that is due to the high
magnification of the output signal vs. the function generator signal. Here it is
with the same vertical scaling:</p>

<h2 id="soldering-it-all-together">Soldering It All Together</h2>
<p>One curious fact about this project is that even though you are building
essentially two entirely separate VCAs, they are laid out differently on the
PCB. I’m not sure why this is the case; perhaps it has something to do with
where the sockets and potentiometers would have landed. But it’s necessary to
be very careful when selecting parts, because the layouts are <em>mostly</em> the same,
except where they’re different.</p>

to be as close as possible. This is really helpful, but it would have been even
more helpful if they had mentioned it prior to page 51 of the manual! As above,
I didn’t notice this difference when breadboarding and had to sort out the
differently specced resistors.</p>
<p>The manual states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can identify these <strong>±0.1% tolerance resistors by their light blue bodies</strong></br>
[emphasis in original]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a difference in the blue, but it’s quite subtle.
The ±0.1% and the ±1% resistors look near-identical, and I therefore had a bunch of
sorting parts to do from my breadboard assembly (made even more complicated by
the fact that 100Ω and 100kΩ resitors also look near-identical when you test them
with a multimeter, and their color codes aren’t that distinct, either).</p>
<p>Adding to the “light blue woes,” the colors in the photo in the manual (left,
below) don’t match the tolerances in the layout diagram (right)!</p>

<p>A <strong>much better way of distinguishing these different kinds of resistors</strong>
(unmentioned in the manual!) is the
fact that <em>the resistor tolerance is encoded in the color band code.</em> So a 1%
tolerance 100k resistor will be “Brown Black Black Orange <strong>Brown</strong>” whereas a
100k 0.1% tolerance resisotor will be “Brown Black Black Orange <strong>Violet</strong>”</p>

<h3 id="choosing-transistors">Choosing Transistors</h3>
<p>Most of the rest of the soldering was uneventful, but when it came time to
attach the transistors I wanted to match them as closely as possible. I have a
component tester which I used to measure the hFE of all four transistors
included in the kit; their values were 524, 536, 552, and 572. So I paired the
524 &amp; 536 and the 552 &amp; 572 transistors.</p>
<h3 id="which-way-does-the-front-panel-go">Which Way Does the Front Panel Go?</h3>
<p>At one point the manual says to attach the front panel, but this kit has two
perfectly symmetrical VCAs and there are two possible ways to attach the front
panel! Only one way will result in the jacks going into their labeled spaces on
the front panel, though (with the “IN1” jack going into the hole labeled “IN1”),
so be careful and check the labels on the board when attaching this.</p>
<p>After attaching the front panel, the last step is to insert the two TL072 ICs.
I always get a little nervous when I do these, because if you insert them the
wrong way you will cook the ICs when you power them up. The two ICs are aligned
differently on the board, the photo in the manual is unclear, and the “notch” on
the IC doesn’t match the notch on the socket, so you will want to triple-check
this before you move on.</p>
<h2 id="powering-up">Powering Up</h2>
<p>Mortiz suggests first testing the VCA using an oscillator
(<a href="../posts/2023-03-02-building-a-synthesizer-3.html">which I have</a>) and
just seeing if the “Offset” potentiometers work correctly, so I did that, and
it sounded fine. Then you’re supposed to adjust the trimpots to center the
oscillation around ground. This is mentioned way back in the breadboarding
section of the manual, but it’s important to set your oscilloscope to DC coupled
when doing this adjustment. If the trace doesn’t move when you adjust the
trimpot then you probably have the oscilloscope input set to AC coupled.</p>
<p>I had to fix a cold solder joint. It took me longer to find than it should have.
Hint to future me: If something that used to work stops working, start your
search with the jack socket into which you’ve just plugged a cable. One thing that
confused me while I was fixing this was a feature I didn’t know the VCA had:
IN1 is normalled to IN2, so you can use one input for both VCA sections (and
similarly with CV1 &amp; CV2). This is mentioned in the manual, but only in the
appendix.</p>
<p>In the trace below, there is a sawtooth waveform from the VCO connected to IN1,
and nothing connected to IN2 (so the IN1 signal is normalled to the second VCA).
The Offset knobs are set to different positions. The yellow trace is OUT1 and
the purple trace is OUT2. I’m pleased that there is far
less noise in this (the PC board version of the VCAs) than there was in the
breadboard version.</p>

<p>With that finished, I now have a more or less functional synthesizer! There is
no filter (yet!), but I can play a note and have an envelope which sounds nice.
I’m very happy with the progress I’ve made!</p>
