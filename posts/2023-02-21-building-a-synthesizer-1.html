<p>This post will be a brief oveview of the mki x es.EDU DIY System.
I’ll get to actual construction in <a href="2023-02-22-building-a-synthesizer-2.html">the next post</a>.</p>
<p>Including the power supply, there are 11 modules in the full system, but two
of them are the same.</p>
<p>I personally think that the single greatest thing you get with the kits is
something which doesn’t ship in the box: The instructions. They are generally
excellent, and most of them were written by Mortiz Klein, who did most of the
circuit design. If you’re seriously considering building these (or any other
synth kits), I’d suggest sitting down with one of the manuals – <a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/media/VCO_MANUAL_v2.pdf">here is
the VCO manual</a>, for example
– as they will not only teach you about electronics and synthesizers but also
about how to teach such concepts.</p>
<p>The full system includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/mki-x-esedu-diy-1x84hp-case/">combination enclosure and power supply</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-vco/">VCO</a>
(Voltage Controlled Oscillator) which produces either a sawtooth wave
or a <a href="https://www.yamahasynth.com/learn/synth-programming/synth-basics-all-squares-pulse" title="Synth Basics: All Squares are Pulse">pulse</a>
(a generalized square wave with variable width). This is one of two
oscillators in the full system. An oscillator is a “thing which produces
sound” which can be filtered and combined by other modules.</li>
<li>Two <a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-eg/">envelope generators</a>
which produce, well, envelopes. Think of an envelope as (for example) the volume over time of
a particular note. If you were making an organ sound, you would want the volume
of a note to immediately drop to nothing when you took your finger off of a
key. If you were making a xylophone sound, on the other hand, you would want
the sound to slowly fade out. The envelope generator produces a voltage which
corresponds to this desired change in volume. However, actually affecting the
sound produced by an oscillator with this envelope will require another module,
the VCA. The full system includes two identical EGs modules. Envelopes are
also useful for controlling things besides volume, such as filters.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-vca/">dual VCA</a> (Voltage
Controlled Amplifier). The primary use case for this module is taking as inputs
the sound produced by the oscillator and the envelope produced by an envelope
generator and producing as an output a sound which follows the envelope in
volume and has a tone produced by the oscillator. There are other ways to use
it, but this is the most common thing to do.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-sequencer/">five-note sequencer</a>
which produces a 3, 4, or 5 note sequence, such as an arpeggio. What if your
compositions require more than 5 notes? Well, you might need a different
sequencer! This is just to learn how they work. But, as it’s a modular system,
you can also do things like clock the sequencer at an audio rate and use it as
a waveshaper.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-vcf/">VCF</a> (Voltage
Controlled Filter). This changes the sound of the oscillator like an
equalizer does. This VCF is just a low-pass (removes higher frequencies). It
also has resonance, which is a signal boost at the cutoff frequency, which
gives the user of the filter more options for the sound they produce.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-noisesh/">noise and sample and hold</a>
module. Noise is simple enough to explain; it’s just a different sort of
oscillator which produces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise">white noise</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise">pink noise</a> instead of a “cleaner”
waveform such as a pulse. Sample and hold is much trickier to explain! In fact,
I think I will defer discussion of how sample and hold works until I look at
this module in depth in a future post, so that I don’t totally derail this post.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-wavefolder/">wavefolder</a>
is a module that takes, for example, a triangle wave and quite literally folds
the wave over on itself, turning the peak of the triangle upside down and
resulting in a jagged edge. In contrast to the rest of the modules, this is
a feature which isn’t found on many synthesizers, although some modern synths
will allow you to begin with an already-folded oscillator by playing back a
sample.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-mixer/">mixer</a> combines
up to three input signals as a single output, and also has a distoration feature
which can make (possibly) pleasing changes to your signal by clipping it. You
don’t have to distort your sounds if you don’t want to, though.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-output/">output</a>
module is a different kind of mixer than the mixer above. It will take either
one or two inputs and produce a stereo ouput by panning them right or left.
It has a headphone amplifier and a line level output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the instructions are <em>very</em> good, as I work through each kit I am
finding that I often want additional information, such as more explanation of
what certain components do or additional schematic diagrams. I will share that
information in the post for each kit I build.</p>
<p>That’s the whole system!<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I will discuss each module in more detail when I write
about building them in future posts. The
<a title="Building the Power Supply" href="2023-02-22-building-a-synthesizer-2.html">next post</a>
in this series discusses building the power supply.</p>
