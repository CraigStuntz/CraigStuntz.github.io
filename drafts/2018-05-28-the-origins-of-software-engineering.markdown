title: The Origins of Software Engineering

It's pretty common for developers to call ourselves "software engineers," but
what does that term even mean? In this article I'll examine the origins of the
term.

Nearly every word we use to describe our profession is borrowed from other lines
of work. "Software engineer," "architect," and "developer" are obviously 
borrowed, but "[programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming)" 
and even "[computer](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/when-the-computer-wore-a-skirt-langley-s-computers-1935-1970)" 
both had meanings predating the software industry.

"Software engineering," according to the [ISO](https://www.iso.org/), is:

> 1. systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, 
> and experience to the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of 
> software 
> 2. application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the 
> development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application 
> of engineering to software 
> 
> -ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2017

Today, people sometimes use the moniker "software engineering" when they want to
distinguish the development of software-intensive systems from what we regard
as "computer science": the analysis of algorithmic efficiency, the development
of new computing paradigms such as quantum computing, and, more generally 
speaking, the study of computation independent of implementation.

## Origin of the term "Software Engineering"

One popular origin story for the term "software engineering" attributes the 
coinage to Margaret Hamilton. Ms. Hamilton was a Programming Leader (her 
title at the time) who 
collaborated on one of the greatest engineering efforts of all time: the 
Apollo Moon Landing. I suppose it was natural, when working with engineers
of all stripes, to view one's role as a "software engineer." 

Others appear to have independently coined the term. Michael Mahoney notes, 
"D.T. Ross claims the term was used in courses he was teaching at MIT in the 
late '50s."<sup>1</sup>

I do think the origin of the stored program digital computer and the creation
of programs to run on those devices _as an engineering effort_ predates the 
use of the term "software engineering." Edgar Daylight convincingly argues
that early computers like the Zuse Z3 and ENIAC and EDVAC did not originate 
as implementations of Turing's 1936 paper but rather as engineering efforts 
where programming and hardware were tightly coupled.<sup>2</sup>

## "Software Engineering" enters the mainstream

In 1967, the Study Group on Computer Science of the NATO Science Committee 
called for an international conference on the subject of software engineering.
[Two conferences were held in 1968 and 1969](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/). 
Of the conference goals, Mahoney notes:

> If one could not define "software engineering" at the time, neither could 
> one point to its practice. It was not coined to characterize an ongoing 
> activity but rather to express a desire for one.<sup>1</sup>

Since the term "Software Engineer" is commonly used today as a job title 
synonymous with "programmer" rather than in reference to someone whose 
approach to system design is based on formal engineering training, one could
argue that it's still used mostly aspirationally.

One distinction I really like comes from Dave Parnas, who notes that 
professional programs such as software engineering or mechanical engineering
have a different intent than scientific programs such as physics or theoretical
computer science:
> Professional programmes tend to be more tightly constrained than science 
> programs because there are many things that a professional must know to be 
> licensed and allowed to practice. A science student is often allowed to make 
> more choices and become a specialist.<sup>3</sup>

## "Software Engineering" in academia

The academic response to the NATO conferences was, according to Dave Parnas, 
> to add a single one-semester course entitled "Software Engineering" to CS 
> curriculums. It was not clear what should be taught in such a course<sup>3</sup>

By contrast, the first university degree program in computer science was 
established in 1953, and the first in the U.S. was in 1962.

Parnas continues:
> Later, as software became more important, CS departments defined software 
> engineering "tracks" that included additional required coursesâ€”such as 
> compilers, database systems, and software test methods. Important aspects of 
> engineering such as interface design and fault tolerance were rarely included.<sup>3</sup>

In the late 1990s, McMaster University 
> ...formed a new department and was offering 
> a program designed to be taught in the engineering faculty rather than the 
> science faculty. It had no courses in common with the previously existing CS 
> program. Students took the same first-year courses as all other engineering 
> students; only at the end of that common first year could they select software 
> engineering as their programme.
>
> ...Unlike graduates of CS programmes, our SE graduates could be licensed as 
professional engineers after passing the usual law and ethics exams.<sup>3</sup>
