Models of circuits: Pretending a transistor is a resistor and a curent source.
The triumph of error correction in digital computers
Pretending current travels at infinite speed. 
Consider obvious things first: (Ground short)
Use a schematic
Break it down into smaller parts (when possible, impedance)
You're going to fail at soldering
Oscilliscope tips: Remember DC coupling
We haven't learned lessons about modularity yet -- small vs. trusted, composed
Digital error correction is really great and analog computers don't have it, mostly
Build a model in the simulator, compare it to real hardware
Test components with a tester
Spectrum analyzers.
