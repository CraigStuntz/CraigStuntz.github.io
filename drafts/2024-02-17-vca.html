<h2 id="what-even-is-a-vca">What Even Is a VCA?</h2>
<p>If you have used keyboard/desktop style synthesizers but not modular synths, you may have seen a “VCA” section of your synth before, or, depending on the synth in question, you may have just seen a dial somewhere with a different label.</p>
<p>A VCA allows you to use one control voltage to adjust the level of another signal. The most common use is to use the output of an envelope generator to adjust the level of the VCO’s output (turning an unchanging drone into a note with an attack, decay, etc.) or to change the filter settings as a note progresses, which gives the note more character by changing the specific frequencies emitted over the course of a note. But there are many other uses for a VCA!</p>
<p>Still, because the two uses above are so common, in many synthesizers the “VCA” is represented as a “Volume” knob somewhere, or as a slider by an envelope generator.</p>
<p>For example, here are two synthesizers with two different labels for the same feature:</p>

<div style="clear:both  ;">

</div>
<p>On the left is the “VCA” section of the Roland Jupiter-8. You get two controls: A simple level slider, and a four position switch which controls how much one of the synth’s LFOs affects the output. On the right is the Retro Synth plugin from Logic Pro; here the “VCA” feature is just a slider labeled “Vol” to the right of the two envelope generators. Neither of these have a “control (voltage) input,” because they are hard-wired to the envelope and the LFO, in the case of the Jupiter-8, and to the envelopes, in the case of Retro Synth.</p>
<p>In the modular world it’s pretty common for a VCA to be a separate module, but you may end up using them in exactly the same way: You want to turn the endless drone of a VCO into distinct notes, so you connect an Envelope Generator to your keyboard’s Gate output and you connect the output of the EG into the control voltage input of a VCA. You then connect the VCO’s output into the audio signal input of the VCA, and the output of the VCA now has distinct notes when you press a key. Success!</p>
<p>However, a VCA can be used for other applications; I’d recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxr5fT-E7m0">this video</a> (particularly the second half) if you’d like to see examples.</p>
<h2 id="how-a-vca-works">How a VCA Works</h2>
<p>A VCA is simply a volume knob which can be controlled using a control voltage. The control voltage is “…typically from -2.5 V to +2.5 V (5 Vpp) for LFOs, and from 0 V to +8 V for ADSRs,” to quote the <a href="https://doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm">Eurorack (non-)specification</a>. There’s usually two “volume knobs,” in series: A <em>real</em> volume knob you can set with your fingers and an electronically controllable volume setting you set with a control voltage.</p>
<p>We know how potentiometers work, and the “real” volume knob is just one of those, with an op amp for isolation and gain. But how does a control voltage controlled volume knob work? If there was such a thing as a “voltage controlled resistor,” that would do the trick. It sounds like something which could be done with an op amp, but it would require a somewhat less common circuit, called an operational transconductance amplifier (or OTA) instead. These tend to have an amplifier bias or <span class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em><em>C</em></sub></span> input which will control the gain of the amplifier based on the current going into that input. But other designs are possible, and as we will see the MKI x ES.EDU VCA is based on individual transistors instead of an integrated circuit like an OTA.</p>
<h2 id="how-a-bipolar-junction-transistor-works">How a Bipolar Junction Transistor Works</h2>
<p>In the VCO kit we used a transistor as a kind of variable resistor controlled by the base input. The instructions spend a good bit of time explaining why a transistor is not, in fact, a resistor. So is a transistor a resistor, or isn’t it?</p>
<p>The answer is a bit of both. A transistor provides resistance, clearly. You can control the amount of resistance using the voltage you connect to the base. But resist<em>ance</em> is not the same as being a good resist<em>or</em>. A transistor is designed to allow current to flow in only one direction, unlike a resistor, and, also unlike a resistor, a transistor will pass a fairly steady current regardless of voltage applied to the collector. So the transistor is not a drop-in replacement for a resitor, even if it was useful in supplying a voltage-controlled <em>resistance</em> when building the VCO. It’s also noteworthy that the VCO required a resistance which varied exponentially with the input control voltage, and thus it’s super convenient to use a transistor, which more or less does just this. With the VCA, however, we want the volume to change linearly with the control voltage, so we will need to be careful about how we use the transistors.</p>
<p>So here once again we get to the point that the purpose of these kits is as much or more about teaching you how electronics work than it is about building the greatest synthesizer in the world. We’ve used a couple of transistors in the past, but we haven’t gone very deep into how the work. So, no time like the present!</p>
<p>If you look up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor">Bipolar Junction Transistor on Wikipedia</a> or in many electronics books, the description will start with a discussion of “P-type” and “N-type” semiconductors, and at the end you still won’t have a good idea of what they do. Instead, I’m going to go with what Professor Aaron Lanterman calls the “magic elves theory,” and describe what they do without explaining the physical implementation, instead saying, “they do it that way because the magic elves inside make it happen.” This is actually similar to <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2015/06/17/the-original-full-size-negative-of-transistor-man-that-was-used-in-the-first-edition-of-art-of-electronics-photos-electronicsbook/">the “transistor man” presentation in Horowitz and Hill’s <em>The Art of Electronics</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="breadboarding-the-vca">Breadboarding the VCA</h2>
<p>The first thing we are asked to build is a volume control using just a potentiometer. Not exciting, but the idea is that a VCA will essentially be just controlling volume using a control voltage instead of a knob. Of course the truth is somewhat more complex, given the need to isolate modules from each other in terms of impedance, but we’ll get there.</p>
