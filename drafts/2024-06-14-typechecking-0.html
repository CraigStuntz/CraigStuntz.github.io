<ul>
<li>Introduction: Type checkin’</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Compiler tutorials often start and end with parsing, and while parsing is very
interesting, I think, there is more to writing a compiler than parsing syntax!
In this series I’ll be explaining how to type check (and infer types from) code.</p>
<p>A tutorial on this should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approachable, as in readable by someone without a CS degree</li>
<li>Thorough, as in covering at least the basics of most of what you want a type
checker to do</li>
<li>Concise. There’s a place for books like
<a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming Languages</a>,
but someone who just wants to write a type checker to learn about compilers
should not have to read and understand a whole textbook to do so</li>
<li>Modern, because type checking has changed in the last 20 years and we don’t
want to leave out contemporary techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>The best introduction to type checking, by the above criteria, that I know is called
<a href="https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/nbe/">Checking Dependent Types with Normalization by Evaluation: A Tutorial</a>,
by David Thrane Christiansen. However, it assumes a certain amout of knowledge
(for example: what even is the ‘untyped lambda calculus?’),
and I wanted to write an introduction “for newbies.” So I will be following his
tutorial, but I will be adding a lot of explanations along the way.</p>
<p>David provides two versions of his tutorial,
<a href="https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/nbe/">one written in Racket</a> and the
other
<a href="https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/implementing-types-hs.pdf">written in Haskell</a>.
I’ve translated those two to a third version
<a href="https://github.com/CraigStuntz/bidi/">written in Swift</a>. Why Swift? It’s not
because Swift is especially well-suited to this task. But I wanted to learn
Swift, and one way which helps me learn is to write some non-trivial, so now
there’s a Swift version. I am hoping that this version will
increase the number of people who want to learn from David’s tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="type-equivalence">Type Equivalence</h2>
<p>In order to learn to type check a program, you must learn how to decide whether
or not two types are equivalent, because a program type checks
successfully when the type it is expecting in some place is “equivalent” to the
type it actually got in that place.</p>
<p>This sounds really easy, and indeed if the only two types in your type system
were <code>Int</code> and <code>Boolean</code> then it would be really easy. But types con be
considerably more complex than this, and in fact when we get to dependent types
we will see that there is <em>no general answer</em> to this question. However, we can
answer the question often enough to make a compiler that works for most of the
code that someone will want to write, and might time out when they do something
extremely odd, but won’t ever produce incorrect results.</p>
<h2 id="meet-the-languages">Meet the Languages</h2>
<p>The tutorial will be in three general parts. You should complete them <em>in order.</em></p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 51%" />
<col style="width: 48%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Section/Language</th>
<th>What You Will Learn</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1. Untyped Lambda Calculus</td>
<td>Normalizing expressions</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2. Simply Typed Lambda Calculus</td>
<td>Type checking and type inferencing</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3. Tartlet (A Dependently Typed Language)</td>
<td>Equivalence, dependent types</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each section will use a different language which we will use to develop our
knowledge of type checking. We will learn how to type check the simply typed
lambda calculus because it is easier to do that than to type check Swift. You
have to crawl before you can walk, as they say. But the principles we explore
here should be helpful to you if you go farther, and, as we will see when we get
into dependent typing, there is some real sophistication in this material.</p>
<p>The langauge Tartlet is a <em>toy language</em> which “is very much like the language
Pie from [the book] <em>The Little Typer,</em> except it has fewer features and simpler
rules.”</p>
<p>Pie, is not used in this tutorial. However, it can be nice to have Pie around if
you’d like to try out Pie/Tartlet with a more humane syntax.</p>
<h2 id="installing-softare">Installing Softare</h2>
<p>If you want to try the Swift code I’ve written, you need a few dependencies; see
<a href="https://github.com/CraigStuntz/bidi/">the README</a> for the simple instructions.</p>
<h3 id="installing-pie">Installing Pie</h3>
<p>If you want to use the Pie language in Racket, (or if you want to try the code
in the Racket version of the tutorial) you will first need to install
Dr. Racket if you don’t have it already. One way to do this on a Mac is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> brew install <span class="at">--cask</span> racket</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can then install Pie using the <code>raco</code> package manager for Racket:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> raco pkg install pie</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can then open Dr. Racket, and type the traditional “Hello World” of Pie:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode lisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a># lang pie</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">'spinach</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then click the “Run” button and Pie will respond:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode lisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">the</span> Atom <span class="dt">'spinach</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve now done more Pie programming than 99.9% of your
colleagues!</p>
<h3 id="installing-haskell">Installing Haskell</h3>
<p>If you want to install Haskell,
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/get-started/">follow the instructions here</a>. This is
optional; you can use it to follow along with the Haskell version of the
tutorial if you choose to.</p>

much of the same material in a very readable way.</p>
