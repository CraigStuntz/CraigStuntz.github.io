<ul>
<li>Introduction: Type checkin’</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Compiler tutorials often start and end with parsing, and while parsing is very
interesting, I think, there is more to writing a compiler than parsing syntax!
In this series I’ll be explaining how to type check (and infer types from) code.
Writing a compiler is a challenging problem, but there are recipes that you can
follow, and if you follow these recipes, then anyone with a bit of programming
skill and some dedication can do it. Writing a typechecker is proving theorems
about code, which <em>sounds</em> challanging, but again, <em>you can do it</em> by following a
recipe.</p>
<p>A tutorial should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approachable, as in readable by someone without a CS degree.</li>
<li>Comprehensive, as in covering the basics of most of what you want a type
checker to do, and providing at least a path to more advanced features.</li>
<li>Concise. There’s a place for books like
<a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming Languages</a>,
but someone who just wants to write a type checker to learn about compilers
should not have to read and understand a college course to do so.</li>
<li>Principled, as a type checker is a proving system about code. You don’t want
to ship the first thing which doesn’t break your unit tests, such as they are.
Instead your type checker should be based around a core which works for all cases.</li>
<li>Modern, because type checking has changed in the last 20 years and we don’t
want to leave out contemporary techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best introduction to type checking, by the above criteria, that I know is called
<a href="https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/nbe/">Checking Dependent Types with Normalization by Evaluation: A Tutorial</a>,
by David Thrane Christiansen. However, it assumes a certain amout of knowledge
(for example: what even is the ‘untyped lambda calculus’ and what does
‘normalizing’ it mean? do I have to learn Haskell?),
and I wanted to write an introduction “for newbies.” So I will be following his
tutorial, but I will be adding a lot of explanations along the way.</p>
<h3 id="but-craig-you-annoy-me">But, Craig, You Annoy Me 🙄</h3>
<p>Perhaps you find my annotations and additions too verbose. That’s fine! Just
<a href="https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/nbe/">read David’s tutorial</a>! If you
<em>can</em> understand it without further explanation, then that’s the most efficient
way to learn the material. My series is intended for people unfamiliar with some
of the knowledge that is assumed in David’s version.</p>
<h2 id="type-equivalence">Type Equivalence</h2>
<p>In order to learn to type check a program, you must learn how to decide whether
or not two types are equivalent, because a program type checks
successfully when the type it is expecting in some place is “equivalent” to the
type it actually got in that place.</p>
<p>This sounds really easy, and indeed if the only two types in your type system
were <code>Int</code> and <code>Boolean</code> then it would be easy. But types con be
considerably more complex than this, and in fact when we get to dependent types
we will see that there is <em>no general answer</em> to this question. However, we can
answer the question often enough to make a compiler that works for most of the
code that someone will want to write, and might time out when they do something
extremely odd, but won’t ever produce incorrect results.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: Most of this tutorial will in fact be dedicated to judging when
two types are “equivalent.”</p>
<h2 id="meet-the-languages">Meet the Languages</h2>
<p>The tutorial will be in three sections. You should complete them <em>in order.</em></p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 51%" />
<col style="width: 48%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Section/Language</th>
<th>What You Will Learn</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1. Untyped Lambda Calculus</td>
<td>Normalizing expressions</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2. Simply Typed Lambda Calculus</td>
<td>Type checking and type inferencing</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3. Tartlet (A Dependently Typed Language)</td>
<td>Type equivalence, dependent types</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In each section we will implement a different language. We will learn how to type
check the simply typed lambda calculus before Tartlet because it is easier to do
that than to type check Tartlet, and type checking Tartlet is easier than type
checking Swift. You
have to crawl before you can walk, as they say. But the principles we explore
here should be helpful to you if you go farther, and, as we will see when we get
into dependent typing, there is some real sophistication in this material.</p>
<p>The langauge Tartlet is a <em>toy language</em> which “is very much like the language
Pie from [the book] <a href="https://thelittletyper.com/"><em>The Little Typer,</em></a> except it
has fewer features and simpler rules.” The only real documentation of the Pie
language is <em>The Little Typer</em> and the only real documentation of Tartlet is,
well, you’re reading it.</p>
<p>The language Pie will not be used in this tutorial. However, it can be nice to
have Pie around if you’d like to try out Pie/Tartlet with a more humane syntax.</p>
<h2 id="swift">Swift</h2>
<p>David provides two versions of his tutorial,
<a href="https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/nbe/">one written in Racket</a> and the
other
<a href="https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/implementing-types-hs.pdf">written in Haskell</a>.
I’ve translated those two to a third version
<a href="https://github.com/CraigStuntz/bidi/">written in Swift</a>. Why Swift? It’s not
because Swift is especially well-suited to this task. But I wanted to learn
Swift, and one way which helps me learn is to write some non-trivial, so now
there’s a Swift version.</p>
<p>You should use whichever version works best for you! (I also found
<a href="https://github.com/heyrutvik/nbe-a-tutorial">a Scala version</a>.) I appreciate that
Swift is not everybody’s cup of tea, which is why it’s great that there are now
<em>four</em> languages to choose from. If Haskell or Racket works better for you, then
use that version!</p>
<p>Personally I <em>do</em> like both Racket and Haskell more than Swift, but I recognize
that there is no “one best” language in the world and that different people have
their own preferences! Swift is also more similar to many other “mainstream”
languages such as C# and Java than Haskell and Racket are. I am hoping that
this version will increase the number of people who want to learn from David’s
tutorial.</p>
<p>I tried to make this series not assume <em>too much</em> Swift knowledge. When I
introduce a feature which is “uniquely Swift,” (as in, works differently than
other languages) I will give a little background on that feature. The idea is
to make the series accessible to people who have general programming experience,
but not so much (or any) in Swift, <em>per se.</em></p>
<h2 id="installing-software">Installing Software</h2>
<p>If you want to try the Swift code I’ve written, you need a few dependencies; see
<a href="https://github.com/CraigStuntz/bidi/">the README</a> for the simple instructions.
My Swift version will work fine in Xcode, if you like that IDE, but Xcode is not
required to work in Swift, and I don’t personally use it.</p>
<h3 id="installing-racketpie">Installing Racket/Pie</h3>
<p>If you want to use the Pie language in Racket, (or if you want to try the code
in the Racket version of the tutorial) you will first probably want
Dr. Racket if you don’t have it already. One way to do this on a Mac is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> brew install <span class="at">--cask</span> racket</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can then install Pie using the <code>raco</code> package manager for Racket:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> raco pkg install pie</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can then open Dr. Racket, and type the traditional “Hello World” of Pie:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode lisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a># lang pie</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">'spinach</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then click the “Run” button and Pie will respond:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode lisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">the</span> Atom <span class="dt">'spinach</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve now done more Pie programming than 99.9% of your
colleagues!</p>
<h3 id="installing-haskell">Installing Haskell</h3>
<p>If you want to install Haskell,
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/get-started/">follow the instructions here</a>. This is
optional; you can use it to follow along with the Haskell version of the
tutorial if you choose to.</p>
<p>I haven’t found a repo with the Haskell source code from
<a href="https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/implementing-types-hs.pdf">the PDF</a>, but
you can get the
<a href="https://github.com/david-christiansen/pie-hs">Haskell source code to Pie</a>.</p>
