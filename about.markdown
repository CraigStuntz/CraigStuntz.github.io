title: About
---
I am a software engineer and a lifelong student of
computer science, with specific interests in programming languages, type
theory, compilers, and math. I co-founded [the Columbus branch of
Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/chapter/columbus/), a reading group
for people interested in academic computer science research. In my spare
time, [I play Irish traditional music on the wooden flute and tin
whistle](https://learningtowhistle.blogspot.com/), and synthwave on some rather
more complicated instruments.

I am Director of Consulting with [Improving](http://improving.com/) in Columbus, 
Ohio. You can [read my full résumé](/resume.html). I work with a variety of 
organizations to improve the alignment between
their software systems and business strategy, using both process and 
technology changes to make this happen. I am interested in working with clients
whose employees are motivated to work together to improve their community,
regardless of the specific technical stack in use. If you're trying to solve 
a difficult technical problem, and want to bounce ideas around, I'd love to talk
with you!
