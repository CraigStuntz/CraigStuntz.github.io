* For an auto manufacturer, developed web services in Python/Chalice/AWS Lambda,
  and identified areas in the code which would be barriers to the business 
  changes they saw coming in the near future
* For a textbook publisher, built an interactive training system using 
  TypeScript and OpenAI/ChatGPT. Worked to ensure the safety of using a chatbot
  in this context
* For a national restaurant chain, rewrote their public web site with TypeScript,
  AWS Lambda functions, terraform, and C# (Optimizely CMS) code. Established a
  "security-first" culture within the team
* For a national convenience store chain, implemented a custom Kafka Connect 
  Sink to replicate data from Kafka to segment.io. Hosted this on AWS EKS with 
  Helm. I actually implemented this twice, which is a fun story too long to 
  include here; ask me!
* For an international beverage producer, wrote Azure Functions in TypeScript to 
  import data from Salesforce to SQL Server Azure
* For a major utility, did a complete rewrite of their web site/middle tier 
  after two other organizations had tried and failed, using Spring Boot and 
  Ansible
