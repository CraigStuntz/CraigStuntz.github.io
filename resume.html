<li>For an auto manufacturer, developed web services in Python/Chalice/AWS Lambda, and identified areas in the code which would be barriers to the business changes they saw coming in the near future</li>
<li>For a textbook publisher, built an interactive training system using TypeScript and OpenAI/ChatGPT. Worked to ensure the safety of using a chatbot in this context</li>
<li>For a national restaurant chain, rewrote their public web site with TypeScript, AWS Lambda functions, terraform, and C# (Optimizely CMS) code. Established a “security-first” culture within the team</li>
<li>For a national convenience store chain, implemented a custom Kafka Connect Sink to replicate data from Kafka to segment.io. Hosted this on AWS EKS with Helm. I actually implemented this twice, which is a fun story too long to include here; ask me!</li>
<li>For an international beverage producer, wrote Azure Functions in TypeScript to import data from Salesforce to SQL Server Azure</li>
<li>For a major utility, did a complete rewrite of their web site/middle tier after two other organizations had tried and failed, using Spring Boot and Ansible</li>
